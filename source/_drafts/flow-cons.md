Apart from ignorance, there could be several reasons why developers might choose not to use a Git branching model. Some of these reasons may include:

1. Simplicity: In small projects or when working alone, developers might find a branching model to be overkill, preferring a simpler linear history to keep their work straightforward.

2. Project requirements: Depending on the specific needs and requirements of the project, a Git branching model might not be suitable or necessary.

3. Workflow preference: Developers might have their own preferred workflow that doesn't involve a branching model, or they might be using another version control system that doesn't support branching as effectively as Git.

4. Learning curve: For some developers, especially those new to Git, the learning curve associated with adopting a branching model might be a deterrent, as they may find it more challenging to understand and implement than simpler workflows.

5. Integration with external tools: Certain tools or platforms might not support or integrate well with a Git branching model, leading developers to opt for a different workflow to ensure compatibility.

6. Collaboration challenges: In some team environments, introducing a branching model might be seen as adding complexity and potential for confusion, making it harder for team members to coordinate and collaborate effectively.

7. Resistance to change: Developers might be resistant to change, especially if they have been using a particular workflow for a long time and see no reason to adopt a new model.

8. Performance considerations: In some cases, a Git branching model could introduce additional overhead in terms of merging and integration, leading to potential performance issues or merge conflicts that developers might wish to avoid.

It's essential to evaluate the specific needs and context of a project and team when deciding whether or not to adopt a Git branching model. In some cases, the benefits of using a branching model might outweigh the potential drawbacks, while in other scenarios, a simpler workflow could be more appropriate.
