    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Flow’s-action-decision-tree"><a href="#Flow’s-action-decision-tree" class="headerlink" title="Flow’s action decision tree"></a>Flow’s action decision tree</h1><p>Advancement in branching models is mostly deterministic. That’s why the term ‘flow’ often appears in branching model names. Internet Guru Flow is a CLI tool for developers designed to automate that flow.</p>
<p>Flow moves forward (flows) on a branching model. By default, it releases the current branch into the appropriate destination. Let’s explore how Flow determines the destination and how you can influence it.</p>
<h2 id="Flow-key-branches"><a href="#Flow-key-branches" class="headerlink" title="Flow key branches"></a>Flow key branches</h2><p>Flow recognizes three key branches: development, staging, and production. These branches ‘flow’ into each other in that order. Development into staging and staging into production. The production branch can only ‘flow’ into its hotfix. The same is true for individual ‘major’ branches (e.g. <code>prod‑1</code>) that follow the production branch while matching its major version.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>flow</code> on the <em>develop</em> branch results into action ‘release development branch’.</li>
<li>Command <code>flow</code> on the <em>staging</em> branch results into action ‘release staging branch’.</li>
<li>Command <code>flow</code> on the <em>production</em> or <em>major</em> branch results into command <code>flow hotfix</code> (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Running Flow with a key branch argument results into similar actions. This works regardless of the current branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>flow develop</code> results into action ‘release development branch’.</li>
<li>Command <code>flow staging</code> results into action ‘release staging branch’.</li>
<li>Command <code>flow prod</code> or <code>flow prod‑1</code> results into command <code>flow hotfix</code> (see below).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Flow-hotfixes-and-features"><a href="#Flow-hotfixes-and-features" class="headerlink" title="Flow hotfixes and features"></a>Flow hotfixes and features</h2><p>Any other existing branch besides key branches is considered a feature or hotfix. Flow differentiates them by their relation to key branches. Feature branches are merged into the development branch. Similarly, hotfixes are merged to the production branch and into the corresponding ‘major’ branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>flow</code> on a <em>feature</em> branch results into action ‘release feature’.</li>
<li>Command <code>flow</code> on a <em>hotfix</em> branch results into action ‘release hotfix’.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the ‘hotfix’ or ‘feature’ keyword results in a hotfix or feature action regardless of the current branch. The default hotfix or feature branch is either created or merged based on its existence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>flow feature</code> results into action ‘create&#x2F;release default feature’.</li>
<li>Command <code>flow hotfix</code> results into action ‘create&#x2F;release default hotfix’.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Flow-arbitrary-branches"><a href="#Flow-arbitrary-branches" class="headerlink" title="Flow arbitrary branches"></a>Flow arbitrary branches</h2><p>As stated above, any arbitrary branch is considered either a feature or hotfix. Therefore running Flow with an arbitrary branch name argument results in creating or releasing a feature or a hotfix of that name with the following logic.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the specified branch exists, it is merged accordingly (as a feature or hotfix).</li>
<li>Else if on a production branch (or a ‘major’ production branch), a hotfix is created.</li>
<li>Else a new feature is created.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Try-Flow-today"><a href="#Try-Flow-today" class="headerlink" title="Try Flow today"></a>Try Flow today</h2><p>Flow emphasizes simplicity in its usage. No arguments are needed unless you want to specify a different or new branch. For ease of use, Flow always prompts for confirmation before proceeding.</p>

    <title>Avoiding Git branching models</title>
    <url>/flow-avoiding/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Avoiding-Git-branching-models"><a href="#Avoiding-Git-branching-models" class="headerlink" title="Avoiding Git branching models"></a>Avoiding Git branching models</h1><p>There are several Git branching models (strategies) from very basic to complex. I asked ChatGPT what reasons might lead developers to avoid Git branching models – apart from ignorance. It provided several valid points, which I have decided to share along with comments and examples from my own experience.</p>
<p>Many of the reasons provided are related to the overhead associated with branching models, particularly the more complex ones. Flow, a command-line interface tool for developers, significantly reduces this overhead.</p>
<h2 id="1-Simplicity"><a href="#1-Simplicity" class="headerlink" title="1. Simplicity"></a>1. Simplicity</h2><blockquote>
<p>In small projects or when working alone, developers might find a branching model excessive, preferring a simpler linear history to keep their work straightforward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This addresses a common question I often get – do all our projects use Git Flow? Certainly not. Some of our small scripts even share a common Git repository for the sake of incremental backups. It is easy to switch to a branching model when a small project starts growing and new requirements arise.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all our projects that employ a Git branching model use Git Flow. The reason is that with Flow, the maintenance difference compared to a simpler branching model is negligible.</p>
<h2 id="2-Workflow-preference"><a href="#2-Workflow-preference" class="headerlink" title="2. Workflow preference"></a>2. Workflow preference</h2><blockquote>
<p>Developers might have their preferred workflows that don’t involve a branching model, or they could be using a different version control system that doesn’t support branching as effectively as Git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience, workflows not matching any branching model are either vague (non-deterministic) or represent a slightly modified version of an existing branching model. Transitioning to a deterministic branching model is usually easy and brings clarity to the whole workflow.</p>
<p>Replacing another version control system that lacks effective branching support can be challenging, particularly for larger projects. Conducting a cost-benefit analysis is essential in such cases.</p>
<h2 id="3-Learning-curve"><a href="#3-Learning-curve" class="headerlink" title="3. Learning curve"></a>3. Learning curve</h2><blockquote>
<p>For some developers, particularly those new to Git, the learning curve involved in adopting a branching model might be a deterrent, as they might find it more difficult to comprehend and implement compared to simpler workflows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For certain roles, even basic Git usage can be daunting. Incorporating more complex branching strategies introduces an additional layer of complexity. This is an important factor to consider when deciding on a branching model.</p>
<p>For junior developers and external workers without Git skills or aspirations, there are workarounds based on their level of engagement. Flow could serve as an appropriate workaround, as long as it is properly integrated.</p>
<h2 id="4-Integration-with-external-tools"><a href="#4-Integration-with-external-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. Integration with external tools"></a>4. Integration with external tools</h2><blockquote>
<p>Some tools or platforms may not support or integrate effectively with a Git branching model, causing developers to choose an alternative workflow to guarantee compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evaluating the need to change incompatible tools should be included in the cost-benefit analysis. Flow, known for its simplicity and versatility, offers excellent compatibility when it comes to integration. For more information, refer to the Flow man page.</p>
<h2 id="5-Collaboration-challenges"><a href="#5-Collaboration-challenges" class="headerlink" title="5. Collaboration challenges"></a>5. Collaboration challenges</h2><blockquote>
<p>In certain team environments, implementing a branching model could be perceived as increasing complexity and confusion, potentially making it more difficult for team members to coordinate and collaborate effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Flow, much of the common development process is significantly simplified, minimizing overhead. Furthermore, linear development can be employed for specific tasks such as creating unit tests or conducting quality assurance.</p>
<h2 id="6-Resistance-to-change"><a href="#6-Resistance-to-change" class="headerlink" title="6. Resistance to change"></a>6. Resistance to change</h2><blockquote>
<p>Developers may resist change, particularly if they have been using a specific workflow for an extended period and see no need to adopt a new model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perceiving no reason to adopt a branching model may seem like ignorance. However, irrational resistance to change is a serious and prevalent reason for rejecting anything. Ensure that you take into account relevant factors, such as the cost of the change and the benefits it will provide.</p>
<h2 id="7-Performance-considerations"><a href="#7-Performance-considerations" class="headerlink" title="7. Performance considerations"></a>7. Performance considerations</h2><blockquote>
<p>In certain situations, a Git branching model may introduce extra overhead concerning merging and integration, potentially causing performance issues or merge conflicts that developers would prefer to avoid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Particularly in complex models like Git Flow, the overhead can be considerable. Flow significantly reduces this overhead, as illustrated in various articles discussing Flow.</p>
<h2 id="Try-Flow-today"><a href="#Try-Flow-today" class="headerlink" title="Try Flow today"></a>Try Flow today</h2><p>When using Flow, the only logical reason to avoid Git branching models is the project size and lack of requirements. The Flow man page offers a working example of its usage. Experience for yourself how simple it is to manage the most complex branching model including development with a feature, release candidate with bug fixing, and hot fixing on production.</p>

    <title>Handle Changelog with Flow</title>
    <url>/flow-changelog/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Handle-Changelog-with-Flow"><a href="#Handle-Changelog-with-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Handle Changelog with Flow"></a>Handle Changelog with Flow</h1><p>A good changelog is a quality indicator of well-managed software.<br>Flow is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help follow a branching model and advance through it. Among other things, Flow helps maintain the changelog.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/">Keep a changelog</a> convention, Flow adds or modifies lines in changelog according to each action. It validates the changelog’s structure and offers corrections if needed.</p>
<h2 id="Validation-and-conform-feature"><a href="#Validation-and-conform-feature" class="headerlink" title="Validation and conform feature"></a>Validation and conform feature</h2><p>Before anything else, Flow validates the changelog on each key branch. It not only checks for its presence, but also looks for required stamps that each changelog has to contain in order to be compliant with the branching model.</p>
<p>Most detected irregularities can be resolved automatically. There is a default structure and a hierarchy of inheritance, with specific entries added consecutively for each branch.</p>
<h2 id="The-release-process"><a href="#The-release-process" class="headerlink" title="The release process"></a>The release process</h2><p>When a staging branch is created, Flow marks the unreleased section as a version release candidate, for example, <code>0.1.0-rc1</code>. Additionally, it creates a new ‘Unreleased’ section for the dev branch.</p>
<figure class="highlight markdown"><figcaption><span>Before</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="section">## [Unreleased]</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">### Added</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> Entry 1</span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> Entry 2</span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> Entry 3</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight markdown"><figcaption><span>After</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="section">## [Unreleased]</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">## [0.1.0-rc1] - 2023-04-08</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">### Added</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> Entry 1</span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> Entry 2</span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> Entry 3</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Any subsequent release of the development branch increments the release candidate number until the staging branch is released into production. Only after the staging branch is released, Flow creates the new version release, resetting the release candidate number to 1.</p>
<h2 id="Features-and-hotfixes"><a href="#Features-and-hotfixes" class="headerlink" title="Features and hotfixes"></a>Features and hotfixes</h2><p>Upon releasing a feature, Flow prompts you for a changelog entry describing the feature. There is a list of commits from the feature branch as a memory refresher. Flow also provides available keywords, with the default being ‘Added’, and adds an automatic entry if this step is skipped.</p>
<figure class="highlight markdown"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="section">###</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section"># Enter &#x27;json-format&#x27; description for CHANGELOG.md</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#   New line for multiple entries.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#   Empty message to skip or end editing.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section"># Format</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#   &#x27;keyword: message&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section"># Available keywords</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#   Added Changed Deprecated Removed Fixed Security</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section"># Branch &#x27;json-format&#x27; commits</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#   593d0f4 Add unit test 29</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">#   264526b Add JSON format</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">###</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Added: |</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The same process applies when releasing a hotfix. In such a case, the default changelog keyword is ‘Fixed’. In addition to features, Flow adds a changelog stamp as the patch version is incremented.

<h2 id="Try-Flow-today"><a href="#Try-Flow-today" class="headerlink" title="Try Flow today"></a>Try Flow today</h2><p>Flow has been instrumental in helping our team manage projects more efficiently for several years, allowing us to deliver high-quality software to our clients. We believe that Flow can do the same for you and your team.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Maintain-a-branching-model-with-Flow"><a href="#Maintain-a-branching-model-with-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Maintain a branching model with Flow"></a>Maintain a branching model with Flow</h1><p>Software development is a continuous process. Maintaining a branching model can be time consuming. That’s where Flow comes into play. It’s a command-line developer tool that automates tasks of maintaining and advancing a project on common Git branching models.</p>
<p>Flow reduces human errors and streamlines the workflow. It enables you to focus on the development instead of technicalities. Flow offers a wide range of features that have resulted from being used on projects of various sizes over years.</p>
<h2 id="Branching-model-automation"><a href="#Branching-model-automation" class="headerlink" title="Branching model automation"></a>Branching model automation</h2><p>Flow automation features simplify branching tasks by providing default actions and advising users on the next steps. It supports parallel hotfixing and can also create pull requests instead of direct releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow requires <em>no arguments</em> and derives a <a href="/flow-actions/" title="Flow&#39;s action decision tree">default action for the current branch</a>.</li>
<li>Flow switches between branches accordingly and advises what to do next.</li>
<li>Flow can create pull requests instead of releasing directly.</li>
<li>Flow maintains separate production branches for major versions, such as <code>prod‑1</code>.</li>
<li>Flow supports parallel hotfixing, even for separate production branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Branching-model-validation"><a href="#Branching-model-validation" class="headerlink" title="Branching model validation"></a>Branching model validation</h2><p>The validation phase ensures that your project is compliant with a branching model.

    <title>Merging branches with Flow</title>
    <url>/flow-merging/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Merging-branches-with-Flow"><a href="#Merging-branches-with-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Merging branches with Flow"></a>Merging branches with Flow</h1><p>In accordance with typical Git branching models, Flow defines key branches, feature and hotfix branches, and individual major branches. Flow helps developers keep track of those branches and their mutual relations.</p>
<h2 id="Merging-key-branches"><a href="#Merging-key-branches" class="headerlink" title="Merging key branches"></a>Merging key branches</h2><p>Flow ensures that key branches exist and are merged into subordinate branches (production branch to staging, staging to development). Flow reports any irregularities and offers to correct them automatically. Such as the following bug fixing on staging:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Before</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">      A---B---C staging</span><br><span class="line">     /</span><br><span class="line">D---E develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>After</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">      A---B---C staging</span><br><span class="line">     /         \</span><br><span class="line">D---E-----------F develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Flow handles more complex merging actions, such as releasing a hotfix. This results in subsequent merges of the hotfix to production branch, production to staging (if not merged), and staging to development branch. It also fixes any partial inconsistencies.</p>
<h2 id="Merging-features"><a href="#Merging-features" class="headerlink" title="Merging features"></a>Merging features</h2><p>Feature branches are created from and merged into the development branch on demand. Flow also checks for potential collisions <em>before</em> the actual merging takes place.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Before</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">      A---B---C feature</span><br><span class="line">     /</span><br><span class="line">D---E---F---G---H develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>During</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">      A---B---C---I feature</span><br><span class="line">     /           /</span><br><span class="line">D---E---F---G---H develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>After</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">      A---B---C---I</span><br><span class="line">     /           / \</span><br><span class="line">D---E---F---G---H---J develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Merging-hotfixes"><a href="#Merging-hotfixes" class="headerlink" title="Merging hotfixes"></a>Merging hotfixes</h2><p>In addition to features, releasing hotfixes requires additional merging. According to branching models, the production branch must be merged into the development branch. Flow takes care of that automatically, including <a href="/flow-version/" title="Version handling with Flow">version incrementing</a> and <a href="/flow-changelog/" title="Handle Changelog with Flow">changelog handling</a>.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Before</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">  D---E hotfix</span><br><span class="line"> /</span><br><span class="line">A prod [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  B---C develop [0.1.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>After</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">  D---E</span><br><span class="line"> /     \</span><br><span class="line">A-------F prod [0.0.1]</span><br><span class="line"> \       \</span><br><span class="line">  B---C---G develop [0.1.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>According to branching models, the production branch must also be merged into an (unreleased) staging branch. Flow handles this as well.</p>
<h2 id="Merging-the-staging-branch"><a href="#Merging-the-staging-branch" class="headerlink" title="Merging the staging branch"></a>Merging the staging branch</h2><p>Flow maintains a staging branch initially attached to the production branch. Releasing the development branch creates a separate staging branch designated for bug fixing. All fixes must be merged back into the development branch until the staging branch is released.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Initial state</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod, staging [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  B---C develop [0.1.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Release develop</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  \       D staging [0.1.0]</span><br><span class="line">   \     / \</span><br><span class="line">    B---C---E develop [0.2.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Bug fix on staging</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  \       D---F staging [0.1.0]</span><br><span class="line">   \     / \   \</span><br><span class="line">    B---C---E---G develop [0.2.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Release staging</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A---------------H prod, staging [0.1.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \             / \</span><br><span class="line">  \       D---F   \</span><br><span class="line">   \     / \   \   \</span><br><span class="line">    B---C---E---G---I develop [0.2.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Unlike feature and hotfix branches, the staging branch is never removed. It is still present despite being fully merged to production. This allows for consistent CI&#x2F;CD in the context of beta-testing.</p>
<h2 id="Additional-production-branches"><a href="#Additional-production-branches" class="headerlink" title="Additional production branches"></a>Additional production branches</h2><p>There is a set of production branches that Flow automatically maintains – one for each major version. This allows an independent hotfixing of any major branch anytime in the future.</p>
<p>When releasing a staging branch, Flow makes sure there is a corresponding major branch. Note that there is always a general staging branch matching the most current major branch. Assume the first and the last state from the previous example releasing a major version of <code>[1.0.0]</code> instead of minor <code>[0.1.0]</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Initial state</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod, staging, prod-0 [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  B---C develop [1.0.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that there still exists a major branch <code>prod-0</code> on commit <code>A</code> with a version of <code>[0.0.0]</code>. When merging a hotfix, Flow selects its corresponding ‘major’ branch. That means any major version can be hotfixed independently regardless of when the branch or the hotfix was created.</p>
<h2 id="Try-Flow-today"><a href="#Try-Flow-today" class="headerlink" title="Try Flow today"></a>Try Flow today</h2><p>Advanced branching models introduce significant overhead for developers in terms of merging. Flow automates these tasks into a single, often one-word, command. With Flow, you can be sure the project is compliant and you can focus on development.</p>

    <title>Version handling with Flow</title>
    <url>/flow-version/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Version-handling-with-Flow"><a href="#Version-handling-with-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Version handling with Flow"></a>Version handling with Flow</h1><p>Version numbers play a crucial role in branching models. Flow is a command-line developer tool to maintain software projects compliant with a branching model. Additionally, Flow offers robust version handling and ensures that version numbers are always in compliance with the model.</p>
<h2 id="Validation-and-compliance"><a href="#Validation-and-compliance" class="headerlink" title="Validation and compliance"></a>Validation and compliance</h2><p>Flow ensures all version files are present and valid. For example, the development major or minor version must be greater than the staging version. Flow not only verifies versions but also reports irregularities and offers to correct them.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Before</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  B---C develop [0.0.0] (invalid)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>After</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  B---C develop [0.1.0] (fixed)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Similarly, the (unreleased) staging version must be greater than the production version and lower than the development version. Flow can fix this as well, including missing version files and invalid version formats.</p>
<h2 id="The-release-process"><a href="#The-release-process" class="headerlink" title="The release process"></a>The release process</h2><p>During the general release process, from development to staging to production, Flow preserves the source version value. After the first release candidate is created, Flow automatically increments the minor version on the development branch for future releases.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Initial</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  B---C develop [0.1.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Release develop</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A prod [0.0.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \</span><br><span class="line">  \       D staging [0.1.0]</span><br><span class="line">   \     /</span><br><span class="line">    B---C develop [0.2.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Release staging</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A-----------E prod [0.1.0]</span><br><span class="line"> \         /</span><br><span class="line">  \       D</span><br><span class="line">   \     /</span><br><span class="line">    B---C develop [0.2.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>When the development branch is released multiple times without releasing the staging branch, versions on the development and staging branches are preserved. However, the release candidate number increments. Read more about <a href="/flow-changelog/" title="Handle Changelog with Flow">handling changelog with Flow</a>.</p>
<div class="note info flat"><p>The diagrams presented only display relevant information related to the topic at hand. Additional details, including tags, branches, and commits that occur in the process, are omitted.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Hotfixing"><a href="#Hotfixing" class="headerlink" title="Hotfixing"></a>Hotfixing</h2><p>Hotfixes are released into the production branch using a non-fast-forward merge. Flow automatically increments the patch version number, removes the hotfix branch, and prompts for a changelog entry.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Before</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">      A---B---C hotfix [0.1.0]</span><br><span class="line">     /</span><br><span class="line">D---E prod [0.1.0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>After</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">      A---B---C</span><br><span class="line">     /         \</span><br><span class="line">D---E-----------F prod [0.1.1]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The hotfix version is not incremented until it is merged. This supports multiple parallel hotfixes. Hotfixes are also released into separate production branches corresponding to their major version.

<h2 id="Try-Flow-today"><a href="#Try-Flow-today" class="headerlink" title="Try Flow today"></a>Try Flow today</h2><p>Flow’s version handling capabilities make it easy to track your project’s progress and ensure that your version numbers are always in compliance.</p>
